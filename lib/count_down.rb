# Build a while...do...end loop that counts from 10 down to 1, outputting the current value during each loop. After 1 is displayed, output Happy New Year!. When completed, your code should produce the following:
count = 10
while count >= 1 do 
  puts count
  count = count - 1
end 
  puts "Happy New Year!"
